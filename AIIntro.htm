<p>About 10 years ago I wrote some software
 for myself, just for my own use, to read
 some news web sites.  It showed me only
 the articles that were new so I didn't have
 to look through a list of headlines that I've
 already seen.
</p>

<p>Then in 2019 I wrote a new version of
 that software in Java.  Now I am using that
 Java version of the software to collect
 news data to use for a Language Model.
 And I'm
 also starting a new project, written in
 the C++ language, to use that news data
 for AI.
</p>

<p>I want to get both Democrat and
 Republican news.  I want it to learn how
 to identify whether it is Republican or
 Democrat news.  I am using Fox News as my
 source of Republican news and MSNBC as my
 source of Democrat news.
</p>

<p>I will be analyzing the English language,
 but also the Javascript language too.  This
 is just getting started.
