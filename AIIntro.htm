<p>I am working on a
 <a href="https://github.com/EricsSourceCode/AINews">
 project</a>
 for Artificial
 Intelligence for news articles.
 About 10 years ago I wrote some software
 for myself, just for my own use, to read
 some news web sites.  It showed me only
 the articles that were new so I didn't have
 to look through a list of headlines that I've
 already seen.  I've started a new project,
 written in C++, to use news data for AI.
</p>

<p>I want to get both Democrat and
 Republican news.  I want it to learn how
 to identify whether it is Republican or
 Democrat news.  I am using Fox News as my
 source of Republican news and MSNBC as my
 source of Democrat news.
