<h1>About Mountain Lions</h1>

<p>I have had a lot of close encounters with mountain
 lions and most people haven't, so I thought I'd describe
 what it's like and how mountain lions behave.
</p>

<p>The first time I learned the sound mountain lions
 make was when I was camping in the National Forest
 near Flagstaff Arizona.  I usually relax and read a
 book at my camp in the evening and in the early morning.
 I usually camp with no shelter at all, or under a tarp
 that I tie up between two trees.  But the view is open
 from underneath the tarp, so either way I don't have
 anything between me and the animals when I camp.
</p>

<p>I was reading a book, and I kept hearing a weird
 sound, so when I heard it again I got up quickly and
 looked for what was making the sound.  I saw a
 mountain lion crouched down and looking at me like
 the way a house cat would look at a small bird or
 a mouse that it was hunting.  And if you've ever
 closely observed the behavior of a house cat, that
 is pretty much how mountain lions behave.  So I didn't
 have any doubt about what its intentions were.  And
 that's when the sound that mountain lions make got
 wired in to my brain.
</p>

<p>I reached down to pick up a rock from the ground,
 and when I did that, my upper body was horizontal
 as I picked up the rock.  It lifted itself higher,
 ready to strike, but then I came back up, standing
 straight up, and I threw the rock at it.
 When I did that it lowered itself as
 soon as I stood up vertical.  It was too far away
 for me to hit it accurately and the rock didn't
 land close enough to scare it.  I reached for
 another rock and this time the rock came down
 right in front of it, and it decided to slink
 off and get out of there.  It didn't like
 the looks of what it was hunting.
</p>

<p>Mountain lions want to get their dinner, but they
 don't want to risk their life in the process.  If they
 don't have any experience with catching and eating
 humans then they don't know if they can do it or not.
 So they test you.  They make sounds to scare you or
 they come closer to you and see what happens.  It is
 just like any human bully.  They will push you,
 psychologically, and see what you do.  If you act
 scared then you are in trouble.  The worst thing you
 could do is run away and act scared.  You have to act
 like you are bigger and badder than it is.  Stand
 up straight.  Face toward it.  Look like you are
 ready and willing to fight with it.
</p>

<p>There is a book called The Dance of Intimacy, by
 Harriet Lerner, and the very short summary of the book
 is that a relationship is like a dance.  If you step
 forward then your dance partner steps backward.  If
 they step forward then you step backward.  That mountain
 lion made me think of that book because it was like a
 dance with the mountain lion.  When I reached down to
 pick up a rock, I looked more like prey, and I could
 see it lifting up a little, ready to strike.  When I
 stood up it lowered itself, as if to say it's not
 going to do anything.  That happened the same way twice
 when I reached for a rock twice.  It was like a dance,
 where when I moved one way it moved another way.
</p>

<p>Another time I saw a mountain lion was near Leadville
 Colorado.  I was reading a book in the morning, and I
 heard a sound, so I suddenly turned toward the sound,
 and it was a mountain lion running straight toward me.
 It turned off at the last split second and ran away,
 but it was only about 6 feet away when it turned
 away.
 So it was testing me.  It was charging toward me to
 see what I would do.  I got up and put my things
 away in to my backpack, while I kept nervously looking
 around, and then I got out of there.
</p>

<p>If you want to attract a mountain lion to you, just
 for fun, you should camp in the open, like
 under a tarp so
 that it can observe you, and camp alone, all by your
 lonesome, and stay in the same camp for a long time,
 like for weeks if you can.  Go off and do some
 hiking and then come back to the same camp, so that
 it can observe you a lot.
</p>

<p>I read an article in the news about how a man
 went out
 to his hot tub everyday, out in his back yard, and a
 mountain lion killed him.  So that is very similar to
 what I just described, where you are in the same spot
 every day, out in the open, where the mountain lion
 can observe you a lot.
</p>

<p>That mountain lion sound is wired in to my amygdala,
 the fear center in the brain.  When I hear it I go
 on Red Alert.  There have been two different times
 when I heard that sound from far away, barely audible,
 and then it kept getting closer and closer.  And
 those were both at about 2 or 3 in the morning.
  One was
 near Ouray Colorado and the other was near Show Low
 Arizona.  But it was exactly the same behaviour.  So
 I put on my shoes, packed up my stuff, and got out
 of there.  I always carry several small flashlights
 with me when I am camping.
</p>

<p>If you see a mountain lion at all, that's a
 bad sign because they are very good at hiding, and if
 it is letting you see it, then it is seeing how you
 will react.  And if anybody ever says that the
 mountain lion is just curious, it is just
 curious to see if it can have you for dinner.
</p>

<p>When ever I hear that mountain lion sound I don't
 wait around to see what will happen.  I know what will
 happen.  It will keep testing me more and more.
</p>

<br>

<p>These close encounters with mountain lions
 happened over more than a 20 year period.</p>

<p><br>List of mountain lion encounters:<br>
Near Flagstaff AZ. I learned the sound they make.
 Threw rocks.<br>
Near Durango CO. Open Space area east of town.
 Threw rocks at it.<br>
Near Durango CO X rock. It hissed, made fight
 sounds to scare me.  Several different close
 encounters near the X Rock area.<br>
Near Ouray CO.  Made sounds that got closer
 and closer.  Next day, got within 30 yards of
 me.<br>
Near Show Low AZ.  Made sounds that got closer
 and closer.  Twice in two different areas.<br>
Near Rico CO.  Made sounds pretty close by.<br>
Near Moab UT.  Made sounds near river.<br>
Near Pagosa Springs CO.  Got very close to me.<br>
Near Leadville CO.  Ran straight toward me, then
 turned off at last split second.<br>
Near Alpine TX.  Saw two mountain lion kittens
 and the mama cat.<br>
That's all the real memorable ones.
</p>

<p>By the way, I have bad vision.  Bad enough
 so that I can't drive a car.  So if I see a
 mountain lion at all, it's in plain view and
 close enough for me to see it.
