<h1>The Advanced Encryption Standard and<br>
 Galois Counter Mode of Operation (GCM)</h1>
<h5>Last updated October 13, 2022.<br>
Copyright &copy; Eric Chauvin 2022.</h5>

<p>The Advanced Encryption Standard is described
 in the Federal Information Processing Standard
 publication 197.  See the Aes.cpp file in the
 <a href="https://github.com/EricsSourceCode/CryptoBase">
 CryptoBase repository</a>.
</p>

<p>The mode that AES is used in (Galois Counter
 Mode) is a totally separate thing.  That is shown
 in the AesGalois.cpp file.
</p>

<p>RFC 8446, which describes Transport Layer
 Security version 1.3, refers to RFC 5116 and
 says that AES with Galois Counter Mode is
 described there.  RFC 5116 explains a little
 about what Authenticated Encryption with
 Associated Data (AEAD) is, and it refers you to
 <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf">
 NIST Special Publication 800-38D</a>.
 RFC 5116 describes an interface, which pretty
 much just tells you what information you pass to
 a function, like a Key, a Nonce, Plain Text,
 and the Associated Data.  So it is
 information you need to know about AEAD
 algorithms in general, but it doesn't define
 "a particular AEAD implementation".
</p>

<p>To read about Galois Counter mode, you have
 to read
 <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf">
 NIST Special Publication 800-38D</a>.  I will
 call that the NIST document.
 In the NIST document it refers to the document
 <a href="https://csrc.nist.rip/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/proposedmodes/gcm/gcm-spec.pdf">
 The Galois Counter Mode of Operation (GCM)</a>
 written by David McGrew and John Viega.
 They are the designers of the GCM algorithm.
 I will call that the GCM document.
</p>

<p>The NIST document is a little different from
 the GCM document, but the NIST document is
 the standard to
 go by, and it also explains things more
 clearly.
</p>

<p>There is a saying among software developers:
 Make it work first, then make it work fast.
 There are a lot of reasons for that.
 C++ is an expressive human language and the
 code should express the ideas about what
 you are working with.  For example if you
 are talking about Galois Fields and multiplication
 of polynomials, the code should express those
 ideas and what they mean.  After the code
 works correctly and it expresses an idea
 clearly, then you can optimize some functions.
 You can make a new function that does the
 same thing as a function you've already
 written, but it does it faster.  You can
 test it against the old function that is slower.
</p>

<p>Being clear and correct is much more
 important than being fast.  And if someone
 is trying to read your
 code, they should be able to read the function
 that expresses an idea clearly, and compare that
 to the more optimized version of the same
 function, and see why they work that way.
 Another thing is that if you are using the
 Assembly language instructions called
 AES-NI instructions, then it wouldn't be
 clear at all how those instructions work,
 even though they'd be <b><i>much</i></b>
 faster.
