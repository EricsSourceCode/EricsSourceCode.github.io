<p>In documentation about the RSA Crypto
 System you will sometimes see a mention of
 Garner's Formula.  It is used for
 decrypting with the private keys.  But you
 pretty much never see an explanation of
 Garner's formula.  So here is the explanation.
</p>

<p>In 1959 Harvey Garner wrote about
 a number system [1] based on the
 Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT).  He called
 it The Residue Number System.  Somewhere
 around 10
 years ago I made a number system I called
 my CRT number system, which is very much
 like Garner's number system,
 but I didn't read his paper until
 July 2023.  Back then I thought I was
 inventing something new.  But my CRT code
 is what he called a Residue Number System.
</p>

<p>In 1959 when Garner wrote his paper
 you couldn't express your ideas in a
 good programming language like you can
 now.  So I am expressing these ideas
 in C++ source code here.  When ever I
 refer to a .cpp file I mean the
 corresponding .h file too, 
<a href="https://github.com/EricsSourceCode/Crt">
 like Crt.cpp and Crt.h</a>.
</p>

<p>The first section of Garner's paper is
 the introduction, then the next section is
 about basic 
 <a href="https://github.com/EricsSourceCode/CppInt">
 Modular Arithmetic</a>, then in the next
 several sections he describes pretty much
 what you see in Crt.cpp.  It's not exactly
 the same, but pretty much the same idea.
</p>

<p>The next section, called Conversion
 From a Residue Code to a Normal Number
 Representation is where he describes
 what is now called Garner's Formula.
 That is different from what is done
 in Crt3.cpp.
 The source code files for the CRT
 number system are in the
 <a href="https://github.com/EricsSourceCode/Crt">
 Crt repository</a>.
 Things for Cryptography are in the
 <a href="https://github.com/EricsSourceCode/CryptoBase">
 CryptoBase repository</a>.
 Check the
 <a href="https://github.com/EricsSourceCode/CppBase">
 CppBase repository</a> for things that are basic
 to almost all C++ programming like buffers for
 bytes.
</p>

<p>What is now called Garner's Formula is
 shown in Garner.cpp in the formula() function.
 You can see in the Rsa.cpp file how Garner's
 Formula is used.
</p>

<p>The GarnerCrt.cpp file has a more complete
 description of Garner's formula than what
 you see in the Garner.formula() function
 in Garner.cpp.  That Garner.formula()
 function is used for only the two primes,
 the traditional P and Q like in RFC 2437,
 in Rsa.cpp.  It shows how the standard
 Garner.decryptWithQInverse() came to be.
</p>

<p>In the GarnerCrt.toInteger() function
 you can see what Garner described for
 any number of primes.  That function is
 tested in the Rsa.makeKeys() function in
 Rsa.cpp.  And it also shows my Crt3 number
 system being tested with the Crt3.toInteger()
 function.  That Crt3.toInteger() function
 is what I came up with before I read
 Garner's paper.  But what is now called
 Garner's Formula is what is in
 GarnerCrt.toInteger().  And also constant
 values from his paper, like the
 A<sub>i</sub> and
 m<sub>i</sub> in are calculated in
 GarnerCrt.setUpConstants().
