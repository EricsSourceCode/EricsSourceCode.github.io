<!--
Santa Barbara oil spill was January 1969.

In 1970 Isla Vista burned Bank of America.

1968 - 1969 2nd grade school year.

  That girl's name was Debbie.
Nationals summer of 76.  Kentucky.
1976 10th grade school year started.
I turned 15 in 76.  Got learner's permit?
Very new at driving a car in fall of 76?
It had to be fall/winter of 76.
Did not go to Junior Nationals summer 77.
1977 Fall: 10th grade started again.
So that was when I needed a new sport.
_After_ Santa Barbara.

1978: Turned 17 in August.
1978/79:
"I'm 17, I can't sign a lease!"
Drugs, needles, bad stuff.
I am so lucky I didn't go in that direction.

-->


<p>Early 1980s:<br>The first computer I used
 was a Tandy TRS 80.  The TRS 80 was launched in
 1977.  It had a Zilog Z80 processor and less than
 48K of RAM.  It had the BASIC programming
 language in it, and that's where I was first
 introduced to programming.
</p>

<!-- LSU in 1984?
Not one semester.
-->


<p>1983:<br>The Motorola DynaTac 8000 cell
 phone was released.  It was a hand-held phone,
 but it weighed 1.7 pounds.
 It was very expensive.  As far as I know
 this is the first commercially available
 hand-held cell phone.  It was called a brick
 because it was about the size of a brick.
</p>

<p>1984:<br>I was coaching bicycle racing.
</p>


<p>1985:<br>I made a mathematical model of
 a leg pedaling on a bicycle in order to study
 efficiency of pedaling.
</p>

<p>1986:<br>The Challenger Space Shuttle
 exploded on January 28,1986.
</p>

<p>1986:<br>A Big Mac cost $1.60.
</p>

<p>Mid to later 1980s:<br>I used a computer
 with an 80286
 processor, running the DOS operating system
 and a total of 1 Meg of RAM.  My job was working
 with shrimp price data and other data about
 the shrimp industry.
</p>

<p>1989:<br>The Motorola Microtac phone was
 released.  It had an 8 character dot matrix
 display.
</p>

<p>1989:<br>The World Wide Web was invented
 by Tim Berners-Lee, but it took a few years
 after this point to become popular.
</p>

<p>1990:<br>After my biomechanical
 model for pedaling, I made stick figures of
 people dancing and moving.  It was writing
 software as a form of art, not for some
 useful purpose.  It was math for biomechanics,
 but it was Art that you could see on the screen,
 in motion.
</p>


<p>1991:<br>Linux first released.
</p>

<p>Early 1990s:<br>I wrote a server for shrimp
 data, and it used SCO Unix on a computer
 that had a 386 processor.  Linux had been started
 but it was just getting going and SCO Unix
 was still around then.  That was the first
 server I wrote.  I wrote it in the C
 language on SCO Unix.
</p>

<p>1994:<br>Netscape was founded.
</p>

<!--
Bob's bus station was somewhere around 1996.
So that Crested Butte bakery must have
been late 90s.
Netscape stock traded from 1995 to 1999.
Menendex brothers convicted 1996.

Liz died in November 1994.
11-12-1994 is what the Westlawn cemetary
 thing says.
Date of burial.
Martin, Elizabeth Chauvin.
-->

<p>1994:<br>I wrote the first
 <a href="https://www.mineralab.com/MineralSearch/">
 Mineral Search</a>
 program for Mineralab.  It was a database of
 Minerals.  It was written for DOS.
</p>

<p>1994:<br>I was still using 386 processors
 and DOS.  In about 1994 I was
 still using a pager and a pay phone, but cell
 phones were starting to get going.
 Pay phones were still common in 1994 and for
 years more.  I used an acoustic modem that
 you would push against the pay phone hand
 set, and you could get about 1,200 bits per
 second over that modem on a pay phone.
</p>

<p>1995:<br>When Windows 95 came out in 1995
 it was the first real Windows
 operating system, as opposed to a GUI shell for
 DOS, and it had 32 bit memory addressing.
 So you didn't have to use the segmented memory
 addressing of earlier times.
</p>

<p>1995:<br>I wrote the first Windows version of
 <a href="https://www.mineralab.com/MineralSearch/">
 Mineral Search</a>.  It was written with Delphi
 (Object Pascal).
</p>

<p>1996:<br>Google was started.
</p>

<p>1996:<br>I wrote Point-of-Sale software for
 an Internet Cafe.  It was written with Delphi.
</p>


<p>1996:<br>I wrote the first
 <a href="https://www.mineralab.com/GeigerGraph/">
 GeigerGraph</a>
 program for Mineralab.  It was written with Delphi.
</p>

<p>1996:<br>The Motorola StarTac phone was released.
 It was expensive but it weighed 3.1 ounces.
</p>

<p>1997:<br>I worked for a company that made
 software for police and sheriff's departments.
 I wrote software with Delphi.
</p>

<p>1998:<br>I wrote the first
 <a href="https://www.mineralab.com/RadiationNetwork/">
 Radiation Network</a> software
 for Mineralab.  I also wrote the server that
 makes the Radiation Network work.
</p>

<p>2000:<br>64-bit processors were introduced,
 so it was possible to address more than 4 gigs
 of RAM.
</p>

<p>2000:<br>The RSA cryptosystem was released to
 the public domain.  RSA was first published in
 1977.  I got interested in it in the early 2000s
 and I got interested in working on how to find
 the prime factors of large integers.  You don't
 understand what Computational Complexity is
 until you try working on a problem like this
 for yourself.
</p>

<p>2001:<br>September 11th Twin Towers attack.
</p>


<p>2002:<br>Worldcom Scandal.  In June.
</p>

<p>2003:<br>Xen released.
</p>

<p>2003:<br>The
 <a href="https://radiationnetwork.com/">
 RadiationNetwork.com</a> domain name was
 registered in April.  Maps on that web site
 come from the RadiationNetwork software
 that I wrote.
</p>



<p>2005:<br>Hurricane Katrina, August 23, 2005.
 I'm from New Orleans originally.
</p>

<p>2006:<br>Google's GMail was started.  That is
 the beginning of the end of the SMTP and POP3
 protocols.
</p>

<p>2006:<br>Amazon AWS was started in 2006.
 Amazon AWS EC2 instances were running on Xen.
</p>

<p>2007:<br>The iPhone was first introduced.
</p>

<p>2007 or so:<br>I moved the
 <a href="https://radiationnetwork.com/">
 Radiation Network</a>
 server that I wrote
 to The Cloud on Amazon AWS.  The phrase
 <i><b>The Cloud</b></i> was becoming
 popular.  I put the server on two AWS EC2
 instances. That server (updated versions) is still
 running very reliably on Amazon AWS instances
 as of December 2022.  <i><b>The Cloud</b></i> was
 a really big thing.  Before that you had to
 run your own server on your own infrastructure.
 Actually Rackspace was introduced in 1998, but
 that wasn't really what you'd call The Cloud
 now days.  Having rack space for your server is
 not the same as virtual server instances in the
 cloud.  Microsoft started Azure in October
 2008, and then everyone else jumped on the
 bandwagon then too.
</p>


<!-- 2007 to 2008 worked on house in San Antionio.
-->

<p>2007 to 2008:<br>The big housing bubble burst.
 Credit Default Swaps and other financial
 things crashed.
</p>

<p>2008:<br>Android (as in Android phones)
 was first released.
</p>

<p>2009:<br>Bitcoin was released.
</p>

<p>2009:<br>In April I started working on a
 new version of
 <a href="https://www.mineralab.com/MineralSearch/">
 Mineral Search</a> that was written
 in th]e C# language.  It was completely new
 software because the old version was written
 in the Delphi (Object Pascal) language.
</p>

<!-- Mineral Search in C# has files as old as
April 2009.
-->

<p>2010:<br>In May 2010, I started programming
 for the Rad Net Android app with the Java
 language.
</p>

<p>2010:<br>The Flash Crash was on May 6, 2010.
 That is significant because it shows how much
 computerized trading and Computational
 Finance were involved in the financial system.
</p>

<p>2011:<br>On March 11th 2011 the Fukushima
 disaster happened.  That was the start of a
 new version of the
 <a href="https://www.mineralab.com/RadiationNetwork/">
 Radiation Network</a> software that was written
 in C#, and a new Rad Net server
 to go with it.  That put the Rad Net Android app
 on hold for a long time.
 A lot of Geiger Counters
 were sold back then.
</p>


<!-- Processor is: PIC32MX695F512H
-->

<p>2011:<br>Started working on the Wi-Gi Geiger
 counter.  It used a Microchip microcontroller
 with 128K RAM and 256K Flash.  I wrote the
 firmware in
 the C language.  It used USB-HID for the
 USB cable connection.  It used Bluetooth
 BLE to connect it to
 the Rad Net Android app.
</p>

<p>2011:<br>In June I rented a small run down
 house in Durango Colorado.  Over the next
 three years I did a lot of repair/renovation
 work on that house because it felt like a
 real home to me.
</p>

<!-- Early August 2012 got a ride to Grand Junction.
-->

<p>2012:<br>Adeline.  She translated the
 mathematical writing of Joseph Louis Lagrange
 from French in to English for me.  Lagrange
 is well known to mathematicians and physicists.
 I totally adored Adeline.
</p>

<p>2014:<br>I left the house in Durango in May
 and went to Michigan for a while.  I'll never go
 back to Michigan, that's for sure.
</p>

<p>2015:<br>The Gold King Mine Spill, in Silverton
 Colorado, was in August.
</p>

<p>2015:<br>This is about the end of development
 of the Radiation Network and the GeigerGraph
 software.  It is still going, last time I
 checked, but with no real development after
 this point. No security updates, no updates
 for Android, and so on.  For all practical
 purposes, that is the end of the timeline
 for that software.
</p>

<p>2015:<br>Mineral Search software ended
 development.  A couple of bug fixes after 2015
 but that was the end of the line.  It is
 still being sold.
</p>

<p>2015:<br>Android app for the Radiation
 Network ended development.
</p>

<p>2015:<br>The Wi-Gi prototype Geiger Counter
 ended development.  It had a Laird Bluetooth LE
 module in it to connect with the Android app.
</p>


<!--
2015 Winter/Spring in Michigan.
  February stayed at Budget Inn while working
 on Rad Net.  Then went to Elko in about April.
 Gold King Mine spill was in August, when I
 was in Glenwood Springs hotel after Amtrak
 from Reno.
 In the fall went to Pagosa hotel.
 RN Time Sheet went to September.
 Had Surface Pro until December 2015.
-->

<p>2015:<br>Invented my own Modular Reduction
 algorithm.  That is used in Cryptography.
</p>

<p>2016:<br>Doing some things with Cryptography
 and also 3D graphics.
</p>

<!--
2016 Winter/Spring at Days End and then
     Apartment across from high school.  Used
 my new laptop computer at Durango library.
-->

<!--
2017 Winter/Spring at Iron Horse.
     June in Crested Butte, then to Leadville.
  Left Leadville in October.
-->


<p>2017:<br>I got interested in Climate Modeling
 and I got far enough in to it to realize that
 it is a life long project.  It also got me
 interested in Einstein's Relativity because I
 was working on how the moon
 and the planets are related by gravity to what
 is happening on the Earth.  I used JPL data to
 get the positions of the Earth, moon and planets.
 It has to do with how ocean tides
 work, but you can think of the whole atmosphere
 as having something like ocean tides.
</p>

<p>2017:<br>I quit using Visual
 Studio and I wrote my own code editor in
 C# for Windows.  The blinking
 lightbulb in Visual Studio, the blinking light
 bulb that you couldn't turn off, that's what
 killed Visual Studio for me.
</p>

<p>2018:<br>Wrote a code editor
 in Java.  That way it could be used on Linux too.
</p>


<!-- 2018:
Code Editor in C# had VersionDate = "8/2/2018";

Code Editor: Copyright Eric Chauvin 2017 - 2018.

John had a stroke at the library on
 the day of Summer Solstice 2018.

2018 Winter/Spring in Durango camp near
// Horse Gulch.
  Near the private road.
 Left Leadville in Early December.
  Had to go back
 up to Durango for
 new debit card.  Stayed past Christmas, then
 hitchiked to Albuquerque to Motel 6 and almost
 got robbed on walk south out of ABQ.

<!--
2019
January: Got very sick in Durango and still
 had cough on
first ride out of ABQ (that rodeo guy) after
 almost robbed.
Terrible climb up hill to camp with flu-like
 symtpoms
in the snow in Durango.  I was _very_ sick.
 Budget motel in Durango on January 3rd of 2019.
  Looked like a skeleton in mirror.
Early January met Shay and got to Socorro.
 Winter/Spring in Payson, then Durango.  Came
 to Durango way too early.  Like mid February
 in the snow storm.
    Snowing in Leadville in May and even June.
 Left Leadville in early July.  Safe Harbor
 Kitchen in mid summer.  Tried to cook there.
  Roswell and Artesia in the late summer.
  Alpine Texas, mountain lion kittens under
 bridge.  Winter on terrible Texas trip to
 San Antonio area.  Lady Bird Park in the rain.
 Christmas day in Brady Texas.

<p>2020:<br>Got much more heavily in to C++.
</p>


<!--
2020  Got new computer in Roswell from that lady
 in late January, then to Motel in Socorro.
  Early spring in Payson.  Still used library
 with new computer then.  Had Covid-19? in early
 March in Show Low?  Got sick March 9th.
  Came to Durango on March 23.  Bernalillo
 April 14th in snow.  Then Durango, then Gallup
 sagebrush cutting ripoff job April 29, then
 Durango Motel May 12th.  Headed toward Blanding.
  Finally made it back to Payson in May.
Working at Rumsey Park in summer.  Back to
 Durango for
 Willow's birthday.  Went to Prescott
 in October. Prescott office
 in December.

-->

<!--
<p>2020:<br>I hitchhiked all over 4 states
 (CO, NM, AZ and UT) during the Covid pandemic.
 I also went in to either a grocery store or a
 convenience store pretty much every day.
 I got sick 3 times
 during the pandemic with cold or flu-like
 symptoms, and I don't think it would have
 been possible for me to avoid getting Covid,
 but I have no idea if I ever actually got it.
</p>
-->

<p>2021:<br>I was working on
 Elliptic Curve Cryptography because I was
 interested in understanding how Bitcoin
 worked.  I was in Prescott AZ, and
 Ridgeway and Ouray CO.  Had a close encounter
 with a
 <a href="https://ericinarizona.github.io/Other/MountainLion.htm">
 mountain lion</a>
 in Ouray.
</p>


<!--
Integers.cpp copyright is 2021.
EPoint.cpp has copyright 2021.
But EPoint was because of BitCoin interest.

Got new ID.
Silverton, Ouray area until mid July.
Utah late July early August
Payson Early August.
Heber Condo lady Early August.
Heber Ramada in park September.

way to Flagstaff, Cortez, Ridgeway, Aspen...
-->

<p>2022:<br>Worked on the Tonelli-Shanks
 algorithm, the Advanced Encryption Standard
 and Galois Counter Mode, and other things
 for Transport Layer Security.  Every
 other project I am working on depends on
 having a good TLS system, so TLS is the
 priority.
</p>

<!-- 2023: Winter camping as low as
 minus 10 degrees.
-->

<p>2023:<br>Worked on Pollard's P - 1 algorithm,
 the Elliptic Curve Method for factoring
