<h1>Distinguished Encoding Rules for
 X.509 Certificates</h1>
<h5>Last updated October 27, 2023.<br>

<p>DER encoding is used in Transport Layer
 Security in X.509 certificates.  Certificates
 are described in RFC 5280.  DER Encoding
 is in the X.690 standard.  The main source
 file for certificates is Certificate.cpp.
 The main source file for DER Encoding
 is DerEncode.cpp.
 In the DerEncode.readOneTag() function you
 can see how it decodes a value.
</p>

<p>The DerEncodeLoop.cpp file is for reading
 a whole certificate full of tags for testing.
</p>

<p>In the Certificate.cpp file, in the
 parseMainCert() function you can see how
 the parts of the certificate are decoded
 in functions called in order.  You can follow
 those functions down to functions that
 use DerEncode.cpp to read the values in
 the certificate.  And in a function like
 parseAlgID() you can see how it uses
 DerObjID.cpp to get an Object ID.

<p>The source code files for most things
 that are described here are in the
 <a href="https://github.com/EricInArizona/Network">
 Network repository</a>.
 Things for Cryptography are in the
 <a href="https://github.com/EricInArizona/CryptoBase">
 CryptoBase repository</a>.
 Check the
 <a href="https://github.com/EricInArizona/CppBase">
 CppBase repository</a> for things that are basic
 to almost all C++ programming like buffers for
 bytes.
